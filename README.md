# AAI-Internship
I worked on a small inventory management project during my internship at Airports Authority of India while I was in my second year of graduation. This is a simple inventory management project in C++


Inventory Management System
Thie program code provided in the CD can be compiled using any C++ compiler such as turbo, Dev, Sublime etc.
When the program is compiled, it will display a list of item category and the respective item code.
It will then ask the user to choose from a list of 5 options.
These options are as follows:-
1. Add a new item
2. Delete an item
3. Display all items
4. Issue items to the users
5. Exit

These options will work as follows:-
1. Add a new item - when the user selects this option, it will ask the user to input information such as item category, item code, item quantity and price of the items.
The items will then be added to the inventory and the otal price will be displayed.

2. Delete an item - when the user selects this option, it will ask the user to input code of of the item that is to be deleted from the inventory. When the code is 
enetred, the item will be deleted and the inventory will be updated in real time.

3. Display all items - when the user selects this option, he/she will be able to check the current status of the inventory. Total no. of items that are currently 
remaining in the inventory can be viewed.

4. Issue items to the users - when the user selects this option, a no. of inputs such as employee name, employee id and employee department will be taken and also the 
details of the items that are to be issued will be taken. The items will then be issued to the employee and the inventory will be updated in real time.

5. Exit - this option is used to exit from the program or the inventory.
